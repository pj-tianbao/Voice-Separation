# Voice-Separation
The cocktail party problem is a problem in the field of computer speech recognition. Current speech recognition technology can already recognize the words spoken by a person with high accuracy, while the number of people speaking is two or more people, the speech recognition rate will be greatly reduced. This problem is called the cocktail party problem. In this paper, a short-time Fourier transform is used to perform time-frequency analysis on a mixed voice signal of a man and a woman. The deep learning network is used to obtain the target soft mask (two-dimensional matrix), and then the binary mask (two-dimensional matrix) is obtained through mathematical operations. Finally, the waveform of the separated speech signal and the original speech signal are observed and compared in the time domain and the time-frequency domain respectively, and the separation effect is evaluated based on this. According to the experimental results, the effect of the soft mask is slightly better than that of the binary mask. In the deep learning network learning process, the RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) of the training set and the validation set converged to 10.32, and Loss converged to 53.27. From the training process, it can be observed that the LossFunction of network has been declining, without falling into the local optimal solution, The drived model can be effectively used for speech signal separation.
